What's the Problem?:
  - Finding solutions to one's daily problems is often impersonal and tedious (image of list of results on google)
  - Big groups are often hard to navigate
  
  - how can we improve on the process of finding help and distributing links and information which helped in answering
    questions ?
  - how do we connect people that want to quickly help (in between meetings)

What's our idea?
  - Platform for questions in native languages
  - Connecting questionee and 'experts' more personally
  - Helper 'owns' a question and is in direct contact

What do we try to solve it? (demo designs and FE????)
  - Pool of questions for a given language
  - Document-database which can be used to search docs for help, or even automatically adds them to a conversation
  - People can join and look for open questions in their language
  - People input documents and tag them so they can be used within the system
  - Growing set of tags for documents (types, language, topic, problem etc...)

Where do we see this going?
  - More than 2 people can join question
  - rating and ranking for documents and answers
  - user login and general safety
